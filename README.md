# apple_health_data
Processing my apple health data to celebrate my 365 days of fitness journey 

Using python and a basic tree parser read and process your apple health data cmon its fun!

Note on file versions: 

Apple has changed the export xml format somewhere between september and october 2022 from version 11 to version 12. During this update I crashed with some xml errors and wasn't able to solve them and process my data until I stumble upon Eric Volter's fantastic app https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simple-health-export-csv/id1535380115. After extracted your own data using this app you can use my reading_apple_health_data_with_csv.ipynb.
